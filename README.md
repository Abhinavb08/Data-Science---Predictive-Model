Big Mart Sales Prediction 

Problem Statement:
The data scientists at BigMart have collected 2013 sales data for 1559 products across 10 stores in different cities. Also, certain attributes of each product and store have been defined. The aim is to build a predictive model and find out the sales of each product at a particular store.

Supervised Learning task: we are given labeled training data (e.g. we already know some of the sale price, for some products and stores);
Regression task: our algorithm is expected to predict the sale price for a given product and store.

Steps to follow:
1.	Exploratory Data Analysis
2.	Data Pre-processing
3.	Feature engineering
4.	Feature Transformation
5.	Model Building
